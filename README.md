# Gradient Descent

This repository contains an implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm using the C++ language. An example of how to use it can be found in the Main.cpp file. Some of the parameters that can be modified for each execution of the algorithm are:

* **NumVar**: Number of variables.
* **NumIt**: Number of iterations.
* **Alpha**: Learning rate.
* ***Dx**: Differential value used to calculate the derivative of the *EvaluationFunc*.
* **MinValue**: Minimum value of a variable in the solution.
* **MaxValue**: Maximum value of a variable in the solution.
* **EvaluationFunc**: Function used to evaluate solutions.
